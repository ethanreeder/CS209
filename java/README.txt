SPACE makes Mario float upwards
+/- increase and decrease the animation speed

Game 4:
We realized the win condition (star) may be off screen on some displays, so we updated the star position to be on-screen. Sorry for the confusion, please grade this accordingly. Thank you!

Game 5:
T toggles TURBO MODE and increases acceleration dramatically
Arrow keys increase acceleration when held down (instead of constant speed).
Spark appears when Mario collides with an object that has physics.
All objects with physics adhere to gravity, and collisions resolve successfully.
