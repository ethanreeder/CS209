SPACE makes Mario float upwards
+/- increase and decrease the animation speed


T toggles TURBO MODE and increases acceleration dramatically
Arrow keys increase acceleration when held down (instead of constant speed).
Spark appears when Mario collides with an object that has physics.
All objects with physics adhere to gravity, and collisions resolve successfully.
